- [x] Using a Bernoulli distribution for 20% of the population and a random seed of 7584, and assuming this 20% are tax exempt, what is the mean tax liability for the individuals that pay income tax?<br>
What is the average and median income tax by phase-out (line17)? <br>
Looking at some tax policy changes, let’s say policymakers decide to increase the dependent exemption to help out larger families. How many individuals see a decrease if the dependent exemption amount is increased to $3,113? <br>
What about social security? What if policymakers decided not to tax social security? Use a random seed of 7584 for 25% of the population, with 50% of their income from social security, and exempt it. How much of a tax cut is it? <br>
Plot scenarios 2 and 3 in Tableau.<br>
What if policymakers decide to say: “Everyone with income below $400,000 gets a tax cut from 30% of FAGI to 28% of FAGI, while for those with income above $400,000, they’ll pay the 28% on their first $400,000 in income and 50% on any income above $400,000. What’s the tax change overall for this group? Plot this in Tableau.<br>
